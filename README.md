# PorousStrips
Numerical computations to solve fluid-solid interaction of porous strips drag through viscous fluid.

## solveODE
Core numerical algorithm to solve the integro-differential equation which defines a boundary value problem of the flexible strip as it is dragged through a viscous fluid.

## optimizeNumerics
Optimimize model to determine drag coefficients from experimental measurements.  This uses the core algorithm defined in /solveODE/.
